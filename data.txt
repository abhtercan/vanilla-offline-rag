Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful neural networks trained on massive datasets.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with generative models.
RAG reduces hallucination by grounding responses in external documents.
Chunking is the process of splitting documents into smaller pieces.
Cosine similarity measures similarity between two vectors.
Vector databases like FAISS are used in production RAG systems.
